The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift), legally S.W.I.F.T. SC, is a Belgian banking cooperative providing services related to the execution of financial transactions and payments between limited banks worldwide. Its principal function is to serve as the main messaging network through which limited international payments are initiated.[2] It also sells software and services to financial institutions, mostly for use on its proprietary "SWIFTNet", and assigns ISO 9362 Business Identifier Codes (BICs), popularly known as "Swift codes".

The Swift messaging network is a component of the global payments system.[3] Swift acts as a carrier of the "messages containing the payment instructions between financial institutions involved in a transaction".[4][5] However, the organisation does not manage accounts on behalf of individuals or financial institutions, and it does not hold funds from third parties.[6] It also does not perform clearing or settlement functions.[7][5] After a payment has been initiated, it must be settled through a payment system, such as TARGET2 in Europe.[8] In the context of cross-border transactions, this step often takes place through correspondent banking accounts that financial institutions have with each other.[4]
